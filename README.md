# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
Work Day Scheduler is "a simple calendar app for scheduling your work day." It shows each hour of the day where the user can schedule their events.

## Installation
In order to access this repository, clone it from [GitHub](https://github.com/kaylab78/work-day-scheduler) using the command "git clone git@github.com:kaylab78/work-day-scheduler.git" in the command line interface.

## Usage
To view the deployed website, [click here](https://kaylab78.github.io/work-day-scheduler/).

When the user loads the Work Day Scheduler, the current date and time display at the top. The page is split into rows based on the hour listed to the left. There is a corresponding save button to the right.

The user can click in the textbox at each hour of their work day and type information about their event, meeting, appointment, etc. 

When the user clicks the save button, the information in the corresponding text box is saved to their local storage. If the website is refreshed, the information in that textbox displays, unless edited and saved.

The rows on the webpage are color-coded. A gray row indicates that the corresponding hour is in the past. A red row indicates that the current time is within that corresponding hour. A green row indicates that the corresponding hour is in the future.
